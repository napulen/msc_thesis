This work proposes running an automatic harmonic analysis over a novell dataset of String Quartets from Joseph Haydn. Using implementation code from David Temperley, Daniel Sleator and Craig Sapp. Additionally, proposes an evaluation method to measure the similarity of the resulting analyses against manual annotations included in the String Quartet dataset. 24 musical scores analyzed and evaluated with a range of 15\% to 85\% accuracy for the Temperley algorithm.
