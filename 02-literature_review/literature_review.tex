\chapter{Literature review}

\section{Harmonic analysis in music theory}
  \subsection{Fundamental bass}
  Rameau's theory, the first theory
  \subsection{Root succession tables}
  Appears in several textbooks, e.g., Walter Piston's Harmony book. Not really based in scientific data, but somewhat validated by scientific research now.
  \subsection{Figured bass}
  Used mainly for performance
  \subsection{Functional harmony}
  Based in Hugo Riemann's theory, it is the focus of this work. It contains more information about tonal context than fundamental bass or root succession theories.
