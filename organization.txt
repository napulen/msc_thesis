Introduction
	[Introduction]				What is harmonic analysis about
	[Motivation]	 			Why is it important to make it automatic?
	[Objective] 				State the goals achieved
	[Structure of the report] 	How is everything organized
	
Literature review
	[Music theory]
		[Fundamental bass] 			Rameau's theory, the first theory.
		[Root succession tables] 	Appears in several textbooks, e.g., Walter Piston's Harmony book, it is not really based in scientific data in principle, but it has been somewhat validated by science recently
		[Figured Bass]				Used mainly for performance.
		[Functional harmony] 		Based in Hugo Riemann's theory, it is the focus of this work. It contains more information about tonal context than bass motion or root movement theories.
	[Models]
		[Classical vs. Jazz]
			[Differences]
			[Similarities]
		[Type of model]
			[Rule-based]
			[Probabilistic]
			[Grammars]
			[Machine Learning?]
		[Target output]
			[Figured bass]					Barthelemy, is the only one
			[Functional harmonic analysis]	Temperley-Sleator-Sapp, Raphael, Illescas.
			[Tonal hierarchies]				Rohrmeier, Bas de Haas
		[Analyzing Haydn]	Justification of approach that fits better for Haydn string quartet corpus
	[String quartets]
		[Musical form and harmony]
	[Joseph Haydn]
		[Who was he]
		[Why is it relevant for common-period]
		[String quartets]		
		[Op.20 "Sun" quartets]		Introducing the research question and justification, what would we expect from running rule-based harmonic analysis models over "sun" quartets, and what can we expect from that?

			[Comparing]
				[Rhythmic normalization]
				[Resolving root from **harm expression]
				[Ignored annotations]

				[Total time units]
				[Percentage]
				[Distribution of degrees]
					[Resolution of degree in secondary functions]
	[Issues]
