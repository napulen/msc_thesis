\chapter{Methodology}
\label{chap:methodology}

As I described during \autoref{chap:literature-review}, the original model from David Temperley divided a system of automatic harmonic analysis in two subsystems: One that performs root detection and another one that performs key detection. \autoref{fig:software_stack1} shows how the core harmonic analysis of David Temperley comprises these two tasks.

\end{figure}

However, thanks to the implementation work that has been already done by David Temperley, Daniel Sleator and Craig Sapp, the idea of using an implementation of this automatic harmonic analysis system over the dataset described in this work, which consists of musical scores encoded in humdrum files, is already feasible. During this chapter I will introduce the software stack, programs and scripts that allow for running an automatic harmonic analysis of a humdrum music score.

I will start from the analysis programs of the Melisma Music Analyzer, which are the core of the analysis, to the scripts and programs of the Humdrum Extras software tools that allow for the use of real humdrum music scores.

\section{The Melisma Music Analyzer}
  The Melisma Music Analyzer was implemented by Daniel Sleator over the work of David Temperley. It takes as input a \emph{Notefile}, which could be said to be a plain-text representation of midi files. The Melisma Music Analyzer consists of several standalone programs, therefore, the output depends on the program that is being run over the \emph{Notefile} input file. However, generally speaking, they all output a plain-text analysis of some sort.

  In order to obtain a harmonic analysis, a Notefile needs to go through 3 stand-alone programs, one after another: Meter, Harmony and Key.

    \label{fig:software_stack2}
  \end{figure}

  \subsection{Meter}
    This program extracts metrical information about the musical piece, using the theories of the Generative Theory of Tonal Music as a basis.
    The output of this program is the same notefile with beat information appended at the end.
  \subsection{Harmony}
    This program takes as input the notefile with beat information (the output from the meter program), and outputs information about harmonic roots for each beat. The name is somehow misleading, as this program's output is not harmony, but a harmonic root. Temperley divided the task of harmonic analysis in root estimation and key estimation, this program computing the first of these subtasks.
  \subsection{Key}
    This program takes as input the notefile with beat and harmonic-root information (the ouput from the harmony program). Something to remark about this program is that it might work with or without the information of the harmony program. In the first case, it performs a complete harmonic analysis. In the second case, it will only perform a key estimation.

    \autoref{fig:software_stack2} shows the flow from an input Notefile to the plain-text analysis that is being output by the key estimation program of the Melisma Music Analyzer.

  \subsection{Problems with processing Notefile files}
    The input format from the Melisma Music Analyzer, yet it resembles a midi file, it is not a midi file. It is also not a standard type of file that could be encountered typically in other software. More important, it is incompatible with the humdrum encoding of the dataset used for this work, so at this point, we are unable to run an analysis over these musical scores.

    However, there is one way around this problem. Using one of the programs found in the \emph{Humdrum extras} collection.

\section{Humdrum extras}
  The humdrum extras are a set of tools developed by Craig Sapp, mainly in the C++ programming language \cite{humextra}. These tools are useful for additional processing of musical scores encoded in humdrum. For this work, I am particularly interested in a few of these utilities that help to pass a humdrum file to the melisma music analyzer, and then bring the output from melisma back to a humdrum representation.

  \begin{figure}[ht]

      \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{04-methodology/figures/3}
    \caption{Automatic harmonic analysis of a humdrum musical score}
    \label{fig:software_stack3}
  \end{figure}

  The first step is mitigating the problem around the Notefile format, for this, the \emph{kern2melisma} program from the Humdrum Extras collection results quite useful.

  \subsection{kern2melisma}
    This program provides a parser to convert a humdrum file into the \emph{Notefile} format used by Melisma. It is the first step in the workflow of a functional harmonic analysis from a humdrum score.

  Once the input file is able to be processed over the programs of the Melisma Music Analyzer, it will be possible to obtain the plain-text analysis of the \emph{Key} program. However, this analysis is difficult to parse as it is. Luckily, there is already a tool from the Humdrum Extras that provides help parsing this analysis, this tool is the \emph{key2humdrum} script, written in PERL.

  \subsubsection{key2humdrum}
    This program takes the output from the \emph{Key} program and outputs a pseudo-humdrum representation.

  \subsubsection{Appending to a humdrum file}
    The last step in getting the information back into a humdrum file is parsing the output of the key2humdrum program and appending this information to a humdrum spine. This process is not done by a standalone program, but rather a program that comprehends all the process described during this chapter. This program is called \emph{tsroot}.

  \subsubsection{tsroot}
    The tsroot programs performs all the steps described before, starting from calling the \emph{kern2melisma} to calling the Melisma programs and \emph{key2humdrum}. Additionally, this program also interprets the output of key2humdrum and produces a final humdrum score with the analysis information appended to it.

    \autoref{fig:software_stack3} could be seen as the process that happens each time the \emph{tsroot} program is run over a humdrum score. This is a truthful realization of the target system for automatic harmonic analysis explained in the first chapters of this document.
