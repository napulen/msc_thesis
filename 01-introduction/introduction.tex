\chapter{Introduction}
In the traditional sense, harmonic analysis relates to a set of music theory studies that pretend to describe the relationship of simultaneous sonorities and generalize rules of how each of the voices involved should move to facilitate and embellish these simultaneous sonorities.

It is difficult, however, to give a precise definition of where the task of automatic harmonic analysis starts and finishes. As will be discussed in the literature review, different researchers have made different characterizations of the problem, sometimes binding these characterizations closely to the mathematical tools they have used to approach the problem, in other cases to the type of music that they pretend to analyze, and in other cases due to other circumstances. For this particular work, I intend to define harmonic analysis based in two simple definitions, and afterwards, the outcome definition will help to describe which are the expected inputs and outputs of an automatic harmonic analysis system.

\section{Harmonic analysis}
According to the Oxford Music Online dictionary, in the context of music, the term \emph{analysis} could be defined as the following: \cite{oxfordanalysis}

\begin{quote}
\centering
\emph{[...] the interpretation of structures in music,
their resolution into relatively simpler constituent elements, and the investigation of the relevant functions of those elements.}
\end{quote}

Additionally, according to the same source, a very simplistic definition of harmony could be: \cite{oxfordharmony}

\begin{quote}
\centering
\emph{The simultaneous sounding (i.e. combination) of notes [...]}
\end{quote}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Excerpt from Joseph Haydn's Op.20 No.3 - II. Menuetto: Allegretto, mm. 1-6}
  \label{fig:harmony}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{01-introduction/figures/1}
\end{figure}

Combining these definitions, one possible interpretation of what is a harmonic analysis could be the following:

\begin{quote}
\centering
\emph{[...] the interpretation of \textbf{harmonic} structures in music,
their resolution into relatively simpler constituent elements, \textbf{i.e., harmonic labels}, and the investigation of the relevant functions of those \textbf{labels}.}
\end{quote}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Highlighting harmonic structures in musical excerpt}
  \label{fig:harmonic-structures}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{01-introduction/figures/2}
\end{figure}

Therefore, as stated by this definition, the process of harmonic analysis comprises three steps:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Interpreting the harmonic structures in music
  \item Resolving these harmonic structures into harmonic labels
  \item Investigating the relevant functions among these labels
\end{itemize}

For breaking down the steps of the analysis, we could use a fragment of a musical score. Figure \ref{fig:harmony} remarks the first beat of the second measure, where three instruments play notes together. Every instance of this simultaneities represents harmony. If these harmonies are clustered and interpreted, we come up with harmonic structures, as in Figure \ref{fig:harmonic-structures}

In order to satisfy the second step of harmonic analysis, we could resolve this interpretation of harmonic structures into some sort of simpler representation. Historically, music theorists performing these sort of harmonic analysis will most likely come with a system of labels that represent the meaning of a harmonic structures. There is not a single labeling system for this purpose. Figure \ref{fig:harmonic-labels} shows three possible representations for the harmonic structures of the same music excerpt presented previously.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Three different harmonic labeling representations of a musical fragment}
  \label{fig:harmonic-labels}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{01-introduction/figures/3}
\end{figure}

Any of these three representations would suffice the second step of harmonic analysis. The chord labels in the first representation are what is commonly seen to label harmonic structures in Jazz and pop music. The figured bass from the second representation was very popular previous to the classical period, and it was intended to aid accompanyists who played in chamber ensembles, e.g., it helped a harpsichordist to "fill-in" the accompaniment during the performance when only one note was given in the score. The third representation using roman numerals emerged previously but consolidated with the theoretical work of Hugo Riemann, and its purpose is mainly of analysis. For this work, I have selected to use the third kind of representation. Further discussion of this harmonic representations is given in the literature review section.

\section{Motivation}
The main reason why it would be benefical for musicians and musicologists to automate a harmonic analysis is because it takes a considerable amount of time and knowledge to perform these analyses. In practice, students at conservatoires often learn the guidelines of harmonic analysis during a specialized course of Harmony. Such a course could extend to several years, making it a difficult discipline to learn fast for a beginner. Even in the case of experts, it might take relatively long time to analyze a piece of music in terms of harmony, which makes the task of automating it valuable even for the expert theorist.

\section{Objectives}
This work pretends to reproduce and apply the current approach for automatic functional harmonic analysis used over the KernScores corpora, and apply it to a specific set of string quartets from Joseph Haydn. Once these automatic analyses are performed, they will be compared to manual annotations over the same set of string quartets.
