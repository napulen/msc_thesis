What is harmonic analysis about.

\section{Motivation}
Why is it important to make it automatic.

\section{Objectives}
This work pretends to reproduce and apply the current approach for automatic functional harmonic analysis used over the KernScores corpora, and apply it to a specific set of string quartets from Joseph Haydn. Once these automatic analyses are performed, they will be compared to manual annotations over the same set of string quartets.

\section{Structure of the Report}
